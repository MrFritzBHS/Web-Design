# Activity: Match My CSS (Lesson 3.3)

## üéØ Objective

Your goal is to use **CSS tag selectors** and **CSS class selectors** to style the provided HTML page (`index.html`) so that its appearance exactly matches the final, complete version.

## üõ†Ô∏è Instructions

1. Add a `<style>` tag inside the `<head>` section of your HTML file.

2. Use the **Style Clues** below to write the necessary CSS code within your `<style>` block.

3. You must use the following seven CSS properties: `font-size`, `color`, `background-color`, `font-family`, `font-weight`, `font-style`, and `border`.

## üßê Style Clues

Use these clues to determine which selectors and properties to apply.

### A. General Styling (Tag Selectors)

These styles apply to all elements of a certain type across the page.

* The `body` of the page has a **light gray background color** (`#f4f4f4`) and uses a common **sans-serif font family** (like Arial).

* The `h1` elements have a **dark gray text color** (`#333`) and is **centered** (`text-align: center`).

* The default `p` text has a `font-size` of **16 pixels**.

* Text wrapped in the `strong` tag should have its **text color set to red** and its `font-weight` set to **bold**.

* Text wrapped in the `em` tag should have its **text color set to green** and its `font-style` set to **italic**.

* The `ol` (ordered list) has a slightly smaller `font-size` of **14 pixels**.

* The `table` should be **centered** on the page (Hint: look up how to use margins to center a table), take up **50% of the page width**, and have a **solid 1-pixel dark gray border**.

* `th` (table headers) should have a **dark gray background** and **white text**. They should also have a **1-pixel white border** for separation.

### B. Class Styling (Class Selectors)

These styles apply only to the elements that have the specific class attribute attached.

1. **`.slogan`**: This class makes the text **blue** (`#007bff`) and sets the `font-style` to **italic**.

2. **`.highlight`**: This class gives the element a **yellow background color** and a **solid orange border** that is **2 pixels thick**.

3. **`.fancy-font`**: This class sets a **monospaced font family** (like 'Courier New') and makes the text as size of **18 pixels**.

Good luck!
